	This research project based on learning medical image analysis with some theoretical and practical researches and activities. This project divided to 3 main stages, the first stage was introducing concepts and approaches; we covered medical imaging modalities, image processing concepts and recent improvements in segmentation and Denoising.  In the next step, we examined these concepts in practice; we provide a handy tutorial for python and OpenCV library which contains various examples for processing medical images. And, in the final step a real segmentation system was implemented. This system uses two different segmentation techniques (Fuzzy C-means and Thresholding) and then combine results. We discussed about its benefits and drawbacks. As a future work, we try to use a more complicated segmentation technique instead of simple thresholding to enhance the segmentation performance.
