# Abstract:
In recent years, the improvement of medical imaging techniques helps doctors to diagnose tumors. Early detection of tumors will increase the chance of treatment and plays an essential role in patient survival. In this thesis project we would like to find how to be an expert in medical image analysis by explaining fundamental concepts like medical imaging modalities and image processing techniques and study recent improvements of segmentation. Also, we provide a tutorial for python programming and OpenCV library to do some practical exercises. At the end of this project we implement a new brain tumor segmentation system based on fuzzy logic and image processing approaches.
